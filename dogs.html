    <p>The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as there are
      well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits
      between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced
      feelings of loneliness from adoptiong a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as <a href="">reduced blood
      pressure and improved lipid profiles.</a> If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for
      your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page,
      you will find more infomation about how to care for your pets thoughtout the various stages of thier lives.

    <h1>Diet & Exercise</h1>
    <p>Throughout dogs' lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed
      the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six months old. Their food
      intake shoud be reduced two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after
      they reach one year old. And a dog's typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The
      <a href="">ASPCA</a> says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death,
      so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated.
    </p>
    <p>Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep thier organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air.
      The minium recommendation time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a reang of 30-120 minutes
      of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imaging exercising two hours per day? Ok, I know that wouldn't bother some of
      you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog doe not mean you are being
      challenged to a push up  contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical
      activity; just be sure they are age appropriate adn do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that requie supervision.
    </p>

  <section class="blueSection">
    <h1>Grooming & Handling</h1>
    <p>Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure
      to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and rpevent matted and tangeled fur
      that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
      especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog's health
      but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse <b>all</b> of the soap out,
      as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since
      harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter
      the size of your dog, you need to be caustios as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle
      the pup with one hand under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest
      and rear as you lift.
    </p>

  <section class="silverSection">
    <h1>Vaccinations & Medications</h1>
    <p>You should <b>always</b> consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
    recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be
    determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include <a href="">Bordetella bronchisentica,
    Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.
